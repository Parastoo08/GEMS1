# Introduction to Resource Geology and Geophysics (GEMS 1)
# Wessex Basin group project

- You can find all files required for this group project on this [link]().

# Summary
The principal aim of this fieldtrip is to illustrate and consolidate your classroom learning on the 
 GEMS 1 module. We will do this by 
examining key elements and processes of resource systems at outcrop in the Wessex Basin. You can find more details in the pdfs attached. 
bring along your laptops, and check that you have the sketch-based RRM software, which you used for the third assessment in the GEMS 1 module,
installed on them. 


If you need to download the RRM software or access a refresher about how to use it,
then look at the material for Session 25 of the GEMS1 module on [Blackboard](https://bb.imperial.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_2676052_1&course_id=_34698_1)


# Assesment
Assessment will be based on a group project that synthesises selected elements of the fieldtrip. The 
groups and project are outlined at the end of this fieldguide, under notes for Day 5. The submission 
deadline for the assessment is 5 pm, Friday 26th May

## Python Environment

`conda create env -f environment.yml`

`conda activate GEMS1`

There maybe some issues with `segyio` and/or `mayavi`. If it is the case you may try other environments. There are two other settings provided 
for `Mac- M1/M2` and `Mac- intel`.
